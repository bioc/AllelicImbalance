CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o genotype accessor requires reference and alternative allele information
    o genotype setter requires reference allele information
    o reference fraction is now accessed through fraction(ASEset, top.allele.criteria="ref")
    o for a more robust performance unit tests are now covering the most crucial calculations, such as e.g. fraction, frequency, summary, mapbias and phase specific calculations. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o ASEset slot for Phase information 
    o generation of masked reference genomes
    o calculation of reference fraction 'refFraction'

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Faster getAlleleCounts()  

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in the "realCigarPosition" function, that otherwise could generate an error.
